# Cursor Rules for Fretboard Scale Visualizer

## Project Context
Before making changes, review `.cursor-context.md` for:
- Project goals and architecture
- Feature status and recent decisions
- Code patterns and conventions
- Testing checklist

## Key Principles
1. **Modularity**: Keep features in separate files
2. **No External Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript only
3. **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new scales, instruments, visualizations

## Architecture
- Each feature in its own file (scales.js, instruments.js, etc.)
- Main controller in script.js integrates all modules
- Visualizations are independent and toggleable
- Note interactions use event delegation

## When Adding Features
1. Create new module file if needed
2. Integrate in script.js constructor and init()
3. Add UI controls in index.html if needed
4. Add styles in styles.css
5. Update .cursor-context.md with new feature
6. Update README.md feature list

## Code Style
- Classes: PascalCase
- Methods: camelCase
- CSS: kebab-case
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing
Verify new features work with:
- All instrument types
- Different keys and scales
- Note click interactions
- Mobile responsiveness

## Important Notes

> **Note for AI Assistants:** If the time since the last README update is over 20 minutes, please update the README.md file with any new features, changes, or improvements that have been made to the project.

## Fault Tolerance

All new features should include:
- Try-catch blocks for error handling
- Null/undefined checks before operations
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- Error logging to debug console when available
- Console warnings for missing dependencies
